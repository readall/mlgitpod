# mcondaml
This workspace does following
1. Setup a gitpod environment with minicond, PyTorch, Tensorflow and keras
2. To use this setup, once the workspace finishes build and you can see some user interface, run ./setupenv.sh (only once and not everytime)

Thanks to gitpod for making such an option available to users like me.
