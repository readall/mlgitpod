# mlgitpod
  Workspace to learn NLP on gitpod infra.
  Uses the mcondaml (https://github.com/readall/mcondaml) workspace to setup the base tools required

# Notes
Use longformer from transformer for document processing
Find simple and fast methods of document loading without dependency bloat

# mcondaml
This workspace does following
1. Setup a gitpod environment with minicond, PyTorch, Tensorflow and keras
2. To use this setup, once the workspace finishes build and you can see some user interface, run ./setupenv.sh (only once and not everytime)

Thanks to gitpod for making such an option available to users like me.

Inspired by (and to a large extent copy of https://github.com/mtvu/miniconda)
